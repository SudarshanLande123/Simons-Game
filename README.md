# Simon Game

An interactive Simon Game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
## About
The Simon Game is a memory-based game where players must replicate a sequence of blinking colors. The game starts with one color flashing, and the player must click the correct color. If correct, the sequence extends by one more color, requiring the player to recall the entire sequence. A wrong choice ends the game, displaying the player's score based on the sequence length achieved. This project showcases my skills in front-end development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.

## Features
- Dynamic gameplay with progressively longer color sequences
- Four color options with visual feedback (blinking effect)
- Score tracking to display the player's progress
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Clean and modular JavaScript code for game logic
